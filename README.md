# CPU-Scheduling
This repository will provide the implementation of some CPU scheduling algorithms.

<br/>The Algorithms are:
<br/>1- Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling with context switching.
<br/>2- Round Robin (RR) with context switching.
<br/>3- Preemptive Priority Scheduling (Provide a solution to avoid starvation problem).
<br/>4- Multi level Scheduling.
