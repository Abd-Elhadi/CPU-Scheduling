# CPU-Scheduling
This repository will provide the implementation of some CPU scheduling algorithms.

The Algorithms are:
1- Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling with context switching.
2- Round Robin (RR) with context switching.
3- Preemptive Priority Scheduling (Provide a solution to avoid starvation problem).
4- Multi level Scheduling.
